	The following OPTIONAL mods to this file are permitted:

	The three arguments to the PS._sys() call in the <body> tag above control the appearance of the cover page
	displayed before your application begins. The values supplied are the engine defaults.

	The first argument specifies the cover page background color.
	It should be a hexadecimal RGB triplet in the range 0x000000 to 0xFFFFFF inclusive.
	Values outside this range are clamped. Default = 0x303030 (dark gray).

	The second argument specifies the status line text color.
	It should also be a hexadecimal RGB triplet in the range 0x000000 to 0xFFFFFF inclusive.
	Values outside this range are clamped. Default = 0xFFFFFF (pure white).

	The third argument specifies the text initially displayed in the status line above the grid.
	It should be specified as a BRIEF (< 24 characters) string, which must be enclosed in SINGLE quotes.
	To suppress the status line text, specify an empty string: '' (an unspaced pair of SINGLE quotes).
	Default = 'Touch image to begin'.

	By default, the engine attempts to load a 24-bit RGB image file named "cover.png" located in the same directory as this .html file.
	This image is displayed underneath the status line. Clicking or touching the image will start the application.
	You can freely edit the appearance of the "cover.png" image file to suit your needs.
	However, the original filename, location and dimensions (512 x 512 pixels) of the "cover.png" file must NOT be altered.
	If no "cover.png" file is present in the same directory as this .html file when the engine is initialized,
	or if that file fails to load for any reason, a tasteful image of the Perlenspiel logo will be displayed instead.

	By default, the engine attempts to load a JavaScript file named "game.js" located in the same directory as this .html file.
	That file is expected to respond to the event handlers documented in the game.js template file provided in the Perlenspiel devkit.
	You can change the "game.js" file specifier in the <script> element below to specify a different .js file.
	The file specifier may be expressed relative to the directory containing this .html file, or may be fully qualified.
	You can also add additional <script> elements if needed. The specified .js files will be loaded in the order given.

	IMPORTANT!

	Altering this .html file, or its accompanying .png and .js files, IN ANY WAY other than the methods explicitly described
	in the above comments can result in unpredictable engine behavior and/or breakage, and is a grievous violation of The Rules.
